This could be ages long, we could go to the moon with this.. we could wrap around and travel to a distant galaxy maybe.. But what then? What's out there? Surely not aliants? But really, we've come so far and it's just going to keep going, like a journey with the longest road and the highest goals -- we just keep climbing and climbing like it's Everest, we're already past the stratosphere and it's getting hard to breathe, but let's keep going anyways. I'm sure we'll make it out somehow, and when all is said and done we can celebrate and call it a day. But until we get there, it's going to be a long road, and we'll just take it bit by bit. Even once the journey is over, there's no telling what's next... there's always a new path and new ways to explore!";
